# turtle-point-plotter
Plot points to be used to draw stuff with python turtle. <br/>
program outputs a list of (x,y) tuples. <br/>
You'll need to implement a method of going over these points and drawing them how you see fit.
```python
def foo(points):
	for x,y in points:
		...
		# turtle.goto(x,y), etc
```
